Audio Dataset README
Overview
This dataset comprises two main folders: "Keywords" and "Noise." Each folder serves a distinct purpose in capturing and organizing audio recordings related to drone activities.

1. Keywords
The "Keywords" folder contains recordings of specific keywords associated with drone sounds using different propellers. Inside the directory of each propeller, you will find subfolders corresponding to different keywords. Each keyword folder, in turn, houses recordings for that specific keyword.

Naming Convention
Files within the keyword folders follow a standardized naming convention: word + distance. For instance, the file "back0.5.1.wav" represents the keyword "back" captured at a distance of 0.5 meters. All were captured at a WPM of 45000 (roughly the hovering WPM)

2. Noise
The "Noise" folder is dedicated to recordings that capture the ambient noise produced by the drone at various Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) settings.
